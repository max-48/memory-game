# Simple Card Memory Game

This browser-based card matching game (also called Concentration) is a practice project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer course.

##Usage

To play the game, begin by clicking on any card. The goal is to match the card symbol with the identical symbol on another card. There is only one pair for each symbol. A star rating is given based on the number of moves to win the game (1 move = two card flips). The game can be restarted at any time by clicking the restart icon on the score panel.
